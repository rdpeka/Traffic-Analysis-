# Traffic Analysis 

## Objective

My traffic analysis lab aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting indicators of comprimise in internet traffic. This lab focuses on understanding the flow of data across a network by examining network packets in real-time. In this lab, I learn how to identify different types of network protocols, track the movement of data, troubleshoot network issues, and detect potential security vulnerabilities.

### Skills Learned


- Analyzing traffic flow, identifying patterns, and recognizing network anomalies that could indicate potential security threats or performance issues.
- Traffic Patterns: Analyzing traffic flow, identifying patterns, and recognizing network anomalies that could indicate potential security threats or performance issues.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Diagnosing network problems such as latency, packet loss, and congestion by analyzing the captured data.

### Tools Used

- Wireshark
